# Python Programming Intern at InternPe
In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that showcase my journey as a Python programming intern at InterPe. I mastered Object-Oriented Programming, creating well-organized and reusable code with classes and inheritance. Additionally, I honed my skills in utilizing Python modules to enhance program organization and efficiency, making the code more maintainable. With expertise in iterators and precision in manipulating data elements, I can confidently tackle complex programming challenges. This repository embodies my enthusiasm and proficiency in Python, cultivated through three diverse projects that span various levels of complexity.

## Curriculum
### WEEK ONE
During the first week of my Python journey, I learned why Python is a great programming language with its simple and readable syntax. I grasped the basic structure of Python code and the importance of adding comments for better documentation. I explored the `print` function, escape sequences, and the significance of variables, including dynamic variables and the `id` function to understand memory addresses. I also became familiar with various types of operators for arithmetic, power, floor division, assignment, relational, logical, and bitwise operations. Decision-making using `if`, `if-else`, and nested conditions allowed me to control the flow of my code effectively. I also learned how to work with strings and lists, including indexing, slicing, and using methods for manipulation.

### WEEK TWO
In the second week, I advanced my Python skills further. I explored tuples and their immutability and learned to modify tuple elements. Dictionaries became my go-to for storing data in key-value pairs and performing operations using methods and loops. I gained expertise in sets, understanding their uniqueness and how to manipulate them with various methods. Loops, such as `for` and `while`, became essential tools, and I learned to use nested loops as well as loop control statements like `break`, `continue`, and `else`. Functions became an integral part of my coding, as I understood their significance and learned to define and use them with arguments and the `return` statement. Recursion, lambda functions, and decorators opened up new possibilities for function manipulation. I also delved into file handling operations, enabling me to work with external data seamlessly.

### WEEK THREE
In my final week of learning Python, I focused on making my code more robust by handling errors and exceptions using `try`, `except`, and `finally` clauses. I also delved into object-oriented programming (OOP), understanding classes, instances, and inheritance, which made my code more organized and reusable. Additionally, I explored Python modules for better program organization and learned about iterators, Python's scope, and useful built-in functions like `random` and `math`. By the end of Week 3, I gained confidence in tackling complex programming challenges and looked forward to applying my knowledge to real-world projects.

## Structure of the Repository
1. [`CountDownTimer.py`](https://github.com/fromjyce/InternPePrograms/blob/main/CountDownTimer.py) : This file of the repository houses a Python script that allows users to set a countdown timer. The script prompts the user to input the desired time in seconds, minutes, or hours, and the timer runs accordingly. It's a handy tool for various time-based applications and tasks.
2. [`DiceAndCoin`](https://github.com/fromjyce/InternPePrograms/tree/main/DiceAndCoin) : Here, you'll find a graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Tkinter, a popular Python GUI framework. The app offers two exciting functionalities - rolling a dice and flipping a coin. The folder includes the necessary images of the dice and coin used within the app, creating an enjoyable and interactive experience.
3. [`SmileSnapWaveStop`](https://github.com/fromjyce/SmileSnapWaveStop) : This repository holds all the files related to the project, which primarily revolves around smile detection using the powerful OpenCV library. The program is designed to capture screenshots automatically whenever it detects a smile. Moreover, I implemented hand detection functionality to seamlessly terminate the screenshot process. Feel free to explore the files in this repository to gain valuable insights into the development and implementation of this exciting project, and witness the capabilities of OpenCV in smile recognition and hand tracking.

## Running the Programs
The programs have been tested on the Visual Studio Code IDE in Windows 11.
